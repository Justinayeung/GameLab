* [Watch]
	"No, please, don't make me! I regret it, I regret leaving, I'll join again. Please!" You don't understand what the woman is talking about. You take a peak and you see the figures grab onto the woman, they hold her down. One of the figures holds onto a clothed object.
	** [Get a closer look]
		You quietly maneuver between cars. The clothed object is placed in front of the woman. She tries to close her eyes, but the other forces them open. 
		*** [Stay quiet]
			You stay silent as you listen to the figure, "The Church of Satan had accepted you with open arms. Gave you shelter, food, and water, yet you deceived us with your cheap conviction to our great demons. You wish to leave? I don't think so." He reveals what's hidden under the cloth. A mirror.
			**** [Stay hidden]
				The woman struggles to break free, she begins to scream in agony. The reflection of the sun in the mirror starts burns her skin, turning it red as it starts to peel, and spots of white, and black, charred skin begin to form. You can't bear to watch and look away.

=== get_caught ===
You start to panic, "I have to get out of here!" As you get up you hear a shout. "Hey, someone's over there!"
* [Look behind you]
	You look behind you and some of the figures had shifted away from the screaming woman and are moving towards your direction.
	-> get_caught
* [Run]
	You begin to run, but your legs are numb from squatting for too long. You trip.
	** [Look behind you]
		You see the figures closing in on you. You get up, and start to run but you feel something hit the back of your head with a thud. You fall to the ground.
		*** [Wake up] -> strangeplace

		** [Take it]
		You're drawn to it. Your hands feel the sharp edges and the flat surface of the object, you know what it is.
			*** [Discouraged]
			You don't want to live in a world like this. {memento} You look at Drew's watch. "I'm sorry..."
				**** [A way out]
				You've already found your resolve, you find peace in taking your regrets with you. You look down at the mirror and at a face that isn't yours.
